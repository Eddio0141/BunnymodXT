This is the Windows 100aa AM TAS. It doesn't sync on Linux, so the player never
leaves c1a0. It can still be used for the TAS testing purposes, though, because
this "wrong" execution should still be fully consistent and reproducible.

This test should sync on Bunnymod XT built with GCC and should not sync on
Bunnymod XT built with Clang.
